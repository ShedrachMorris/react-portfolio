# React Portfolio (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This folder contains a Vite + React conversion of the original static portfolio.

Quick start:

1. cd react-portfolio
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Notes:

- Tailwind is configured. If the editor shows CSS errors for `@tailwind` or `@apply`, that's normal until build tools run.
- Assets were copied into `public/` so references like `/img/hero.jpg` work.
- I kept the layout and classes close to the original; refinements and responsive tweaks are left for you.
